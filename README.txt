For our project to run properly, it must be compiled with the math library (-lm).

Wes created a GitHub repository so we could all share the work. Conner had finished the sequential version
very quickly after this was created and uploaded the work for us to all see. From here, Wesley began
implementing the MPI version. Later, Conner, Austin, and I continued to work on the MPI implementation.
We were able to make progress at this point, however became stuck when we were having issues receiving
messages at rank 0. We ended this meeting, with emailing you for suggestions. The next day, Conner and Wes met
to work on the suggestions you had made in the email. After this meeting, Conner and Wes had the code working
for one thread. From here individual efforts began. We kept an open line of communication in our group chat,
and updated versions of the code being sent out. We had a constant flow of suggestions being sent, as we terminated
to add some of the structure from the examples in class to our code, in hopes of improvement. Austin
was able to fix the code to get half of the image to print. With this in mind, we had planned
on having another meeting Sunday morning to finish everything up, however we canceled this meeting when
Conner found a solution to our issues last night. As a whole, I feel everyone contributed and worked well
together for this project. I believe I ended up being the weakest link and contributing the least, however
I have still been feeling poorly due to the flu (hopefully, I will be able to make this up to them if we have
any future group projects).
